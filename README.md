# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## GitHub Pages

Page is deployed with github pages [Covered Test Project](https://its-segu.github.io/covered/).

## Focus

React JS \
State Management \
Error Handling \
Animation/Design \
UI/UX \
Responsive Design \
React Browser \
Regex for input validation

I focused on the UI and animations for this project. I made this page fully responsive and used ephemeral storage in the form of state management using 'use-global-hook'. I also added some form validation to the form using Regular expressions for Numerical and Alphabetical validation. 

## Libraries

React Browser\
Material UI\
Animate On Scroll\
Use-global-hook\
react-hook-form

## Future features

I would add testing to this project. Further fix the UI components and copy. Add a CI/CD pipeline that checks for errors, linting and passes tests before deployment. Perhaps Kubernetes and docker would be needed for scaling as well.
